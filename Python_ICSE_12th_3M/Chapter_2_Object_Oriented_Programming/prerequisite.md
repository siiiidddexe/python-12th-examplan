# Prerequisites for Chapter 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

To successfully undertake this chapter, students should have:

1.  **Strong Foundation in Chapter 1**:
    *   Proficiency with Python syntax, variables, and data types.
    *   Solid understanding of functions, arguments, and scope.
    *   Familiarity with control structures (loops and conditionals).

2.  **Conceptual Understanding**:
    *   Ability to think abstractly about real-world entities (e.g., a "Car" has properties like color and model, and behaviors like drive and stop).
    *   Basic understanding of modular programming (breaking code into smaller parts).

3.  **Terminology**:
    *   Familiarity with terms like "Data", "Function", "Attribute", and "Behavior" is helpful.

## Time Commitment for 3-Month Course
*   This chapter will be covered in **3 weeks (Days 36-56)**
*   Daily commitment: **2 hours** (intensive pace)
*   Focus on coding practice with real-world OOP examples
