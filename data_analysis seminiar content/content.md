### Live Demo: Excel to Python Pipeline

**Example Dataset: Student Performance Analysis**

#### Excel Approach:
```
1. Import data
2. Use AVERAGE() for grades
3. Create Pivot Table for subject-wise performance
4. Insert column/bar chart
```

#### Python Approach:
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('student_data.csv')

# Calculate averages
avg_scores = df.groupby('subject')['score'].mean()

# Visualize
avg_scores.plot(kind='bar')
plt.title('Average Scores by Subject')
plt.show()
```
