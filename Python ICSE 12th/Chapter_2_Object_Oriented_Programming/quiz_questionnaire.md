## Section C: Programming Questions (5 Marks each)

11. Create a class `Rectangle` with attributes `length` and `width`. Add methods to calculate `area()` and `perimeter()`. Create an object and print its area and perimeter.
12. Create a class `Employee` with attributes `name` and `salary`. Create a subclass `Manager` that inherits from `Employee` and adds an attribute `department`. Write a method in `Manager` to display all details.
13. Implement a class `BankAccount` with methods `deposit(amount)` and `withdraw(amount)`. Ensure that withdrawal is only possible if the balance is sufficient. Initialize balance to 0.
