1. Programming and computational thinking
Introduction to programming: Basic Python syntax, data types, input/output, and comments.
Operators: Arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, and bitwise operators.
Control structures: Conditional statements (if, if-elif-else) and loops (for, while).
Data structures: Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries, including operations and methods.
Functions: Defining, calling, and working with arguments and recursion. 
2. Object-oriented programming (OOP)
Classes and objects: Creating and using classes to model real-world objects.
Inheritance: Creating new classes from existing ones. 
3. File handling and exception handling
File operations: Opening, reading, writing, and closing text files.
Exception handling: Using try, except, finally to manage errors gracefully. 
4. Libraries and modules
Built-in modules: Importing and using Python's standard libraries.
User-defined modules: Creating and organizing code into modules.
